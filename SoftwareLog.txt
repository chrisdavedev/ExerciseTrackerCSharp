	[x] Convert Cardio duration to seconds from MM:SS format in input
	[x] Complete Log Weightlifting Exercise
	[ ] Need to specify in help menu that this will create a new session for the single exercise.

UPCOMING FEATURES:
- LogSession
	- Thinking to call LogExercise() in a loop and print out "=== Log Exercise X ===" 
- ListAllSessions
	- Currently 'SELECT * FROM lifts;' 
	- probably want to select *, then read into a list, and clean output for modification in console
- ViewSession()
	- 
- ModifySession (modify a session)
- DeleteSession (delete a session)
- ValidateExerciseName() 
	- Rename Lifts that are similar or have typos? Validate LiftName before committing to Database
	- Get a list of all Exercise_Name's in table, check it against new session's exercises and ask user 'did you mean NAME?'?
	- probably drop "ValidateExerciseName()" into LogExercise
	- brainstorm ways to select from predefined list of lifts (i.e enter Barbell Bench, gives options for Barbell Pressing movements)
